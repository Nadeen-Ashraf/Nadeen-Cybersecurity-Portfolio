# 🛰 Home SOC & SIEM with Wazuh

**Status:** Planning & Setup

## Project Overview

In this project, I am building a small home Security Operations Center (SOC) using:

- **Wazuh** as a SIEM & XDR platform
- A **Linux virtual machine** as the Wazuh server
- Endpoint agents to collect logs and detect attacks

## Goals

- Collect and analyze security logs from endpoints
- Simulate basic attacks (e.g., brute-force, port scans)
- Create detection rules and view alerts inside Wazuh
- Write a professional incident report based on findings

More details, diagrams, and screenshots will be added as I progress.
